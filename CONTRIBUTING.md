## üìù How to Contribute

### 1. Find an Issue
Browse our [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/volcano-llm/issues) labeled:
- `good first issue` - Perfect for newcomers
- `help wanted` - We need your expertise
- `enhancement` - New features
- `bug` - Something needs fixing

### 2. Fork & Branch
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/volcano-llm
cd volcano-llm

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/volcano-llm

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

#### Adding a New Tool
1. Create tool definition in `repos/tools/`
2. Implement tool in `pkg/tools/`
3. Add tests in `pkg/tools/your_tool_test.go`
4. Register in `pkg/tools/registry.go`

Example:
```go
// pkg/tools/weather_tool.go
type WeatherTool struct {
    BaseTools
}

func (t *WeatherTool) Execute(ctx context.Context, input ToolInput) (ToolOutput, error) {
    // Your implementation
}
```

#### Adding a Workflow
1. Define workflow in `repos/workflows/`
2. Implement activities in `pkg/temporal/activities/`
3. Add workflow logic in `pkg/temporal/workflows/`
4. Write integration tests

### 4. Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./pkg/tools/...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./pkg/...

# Run integration tests
docker-compose up -d
go test -tags=integration ./test/...
```

### 5. Code Style

We use standard Go formatting:
```bash
# Format your code
go fmt ./...

# Run linter
golangci-lint run

# Check for issues
go vet ./...
```

#### Style Guidelines
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Follow Go idioms and best practices
- Performance matters - benchmark critical paths

### 6. Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:
```
feat: add weather tool for forecast queries
fix: correct entity extraction for dates
docs: update architecture diagram
test: add benchmarks for calculator tool
refactor: simplify workflow execution logic
```

### 7. Submit Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Create a Pull Request against `main`
3. Fill out the PR template
4. Wait for review and address feedback

#### PR Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Performance improvement

- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed

```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### When Adding Tools
- Tools must be deterministic
- Execution time should be <100ms
- No external API calls in Fast Path tools
- Use Temporal activities for long-running operations

### When Adding Workflows
- Keep workflows idempotent
- Use Temporal's built-in retry mechanisms
- Document failure scenarios
- Add monitoring/metrics

### Git-Native Principles
- All configuration via Git files
- Hot-reload must work without restart
- Multi-tenant isolation via branches
- No hardcoded values

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports
Include:
- Volcano LLM version
- Go version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs

### Feature Requests
Describe:
- The problem you're solving
- Proposed solution
- Alternative approaches considered
- Impact on existing features

## üìä Performance Contributions

If you're optimizing performance:
1. Include benchmark before/after
2. Document the optimization
3. Ensure no regression in functionality
4. Consider memory allocation

Example:
```go
// Before: 45ms, 1000 allocations
// After: 25ms, 10 allocations
func BenchmarkCalculator(b *testing.B) {
    // Your benchmark
}
```
